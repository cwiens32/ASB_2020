# Introduction

- Known
  - Basketball shots are taken from varying distance from hoop
  - Distance affects max angular velocity [@Nakano2018] and timing of max upper extremity joint angular velocities [@Podmenik2017, @Miller1993] relative to ball release
  - Releasing the ball earlier relative to center of mass (CM) trajectory apex increases the CM vertical velocity contribution to ball vertical velocity [@Wiens]
- Unknown
  - How individuals control their upper extremity in relation to CM trajectory during shooting motion

## Hypothesis

- Upper extremity shot initiation would occur earlier relative to CM trajectory apex

# Methods

- Participants
  - 7 recreational players (4 female; college-aged)
- Basketball shot at game pace
  - Minimum 10 attempts at each distance
- Motion capture
  - Ball motion (Panasonic, 120Hz)
- Force-Time Characteristics
  - Net impulse = change in momentum (Kistler, 1200Hz)
- Wearable sensors
  - Arm segment motion (APDM, 120Hz)

# Stats
- Upper extremity shot initiation: earliest event of following:
  - Earliest event between: shoulder flexion or elbow extension
- Within-participant differences between shot distances
  - Multiple comparisons on difference scores
  - p-values adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Wilcox2017]

# Results

```{r animateplot}
ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(time2apex_shotinit, ball_velocity_release_y, color = athlete_id, shape = distancename)) +
  labs(x = "Time from Upper Extremity Shot Initiation to CM Trajectory Apex (s)",
       y = "Ball Vertical Velocity at Release (m/s)",
       color = "Participant",
       shape = "Distance") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), alpha = 0.4) +
  transition_states(distancename,
                    transition_length = 2,
                    state_length = 1) +
  shadow_mark()
```


# Discussion

- Changes in timing of upper extremity shot initiation in relation to CM trajectory apex were associated with differences in ball vertical velocity at release
- Timing of upper body shooting motion relative to whole body motion may affect ball release angle, subsequently affecting performance outcomes
