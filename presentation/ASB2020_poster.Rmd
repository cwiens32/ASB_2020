# Introduction

- In the course of play, basketball shots are taken from varying distances from hoop.
- A change in shot distance affects the max angular velocity [@Nakano2018] and timing of max upper extremity joint angular velocities [@Podmenik2017; @Miller1993] relative to ball release.
- By releasing the ball earlier relative to center of mass (CM) trajectory apex, the CM vertical velocity's contribution to the ball vertical velocity is increased [@Wiens2020]. The timing between ball release and CM trajectory apex increases with increase in shot distance [@Wiens2020].
- Do individuals control the timing of the upper extremity shot initiation relative to the CM trajectory at varying distances?

## Hypothesis

- Upper extremity shot initiation would occur earlier relative to CM trajectory apex with increase in shot distance

# Experimental Design

- Participants
  - 7 recreational players (4 female; college-aged; >10 years experience)
- Experimental Task
  - Received chest pass from person under hoop
  - Minimum 10 attempts at three distances
    - Long: high school three-point line (6.02m)
    - Medium: free throw (4.57m)
    - Short: < 2.5m

# Data Collection
- Motion capture
  - Video of ball motion (Panasonic, 120Hz)
  - Wearable inertial measurement units of upper extremity (APDM, 120Hz)
- Force measurements
  - Two portable force plates (Kistler, 1200Hz)

# Data Analysis
- Center of mass velocity
  - Net impulse = change in momentum (using force measurements)
- Ball release velocity
  - Projectile motion equations
- Time of apex of center of mass trajectory
  - Projectile motion equations
- Time of upper extremity shot initiation: earliest event of following:
  - Earliest event between: shoulder flexion or elbow extension
- Within-participant differences between shot distances
  - Multiple comparisons on difference scores
  - p-values adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Wilcox2017]

# Results

Upper extremity shot initiation occurred significantly earlier relative to CM trajectory apex with increase in shot distance for all 7 participants.

# Discussion

- Upper extremity shot initiation was found to occur earlier relative to CM trajectory apex with increase in shot distance
- These results are consistent with previous research indicating shot distance affects timing of upper extremity motion [@Nakano2018; @Podmenik2017; @Miller1993]
- Initiating the upper arm shooting motion earlier relative to CM apex may be an attempt to take advantage of the CM vertical velocity at ball release [@Wiens2020]
- Changes in the timing of upper extremity shot initiation in relation to the CM trajectory apex were associated with differences in ball vertical velocity at release
- Timing of upper body shooting motion relative to whole body motion may affect ball release angle, subsequently affecting performance outcomes
