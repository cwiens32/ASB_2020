abstract = {The aim of our research was to describe the joint angular velocities of young basketball players (U16) during their performance of jump shots and to find out what was the effect of increasing shooting range on these velocities. Our sample included 14 players that performed the function of guards. Their average age (±SD) was 15.43±0.51 years. The analysis contemplated 370 field goals, which were performed from three different distances (3.75 m, 5.25 m and 6.75 m) perpendicular to the hoop board. The measurements were performed using an Xsens MVN inertial suit. The results showed that the maximum angular velocity in the shoulder and elbow joint became greater with the increase of shooting range. In the throw from the shortest distance, the segments were integrated into the movement of the shooting arm according to the proximal-distal principle. The temporal sequences of maxima velocities in legs were preserved in throws from all the three distances. The findings are important for young basketball players and their coaches. They have to be aware of the needed adjustments to the techniques of throws from various ranges and they must take them into account when practicing.},

@article{Nakano2018,
abstract = {The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of shooting distance on energy flow in basketball jump shot. Ten male right-handed basketball players participated in this study, and three successful shots at three different distances (short condition, equating to a free-throw; long condition, equating to a three-point shot; and mid condition, equating to the mid-point of the short- and long-condition shots) were recorded using a motion capture system and force platforms. Kinetic variables of joints during shooting were analysed using inverse dynamics method. Our results showed that the joint work was not significantly different for short- and mid-condition shots; however, the amount of energy transferred from the torso to the shooting arm by the shoulder joint force increased significantly for the mid-condition shots ([Formula: see text] as opposed to [Formula: see text] J/kg, [Formula: see text]), whereas between the mid- and long-conditions, it was found that the joint work in the lower limbs increased significantly ([Formula: see text] as opposed to [Formula: see text] J/kg, [Formula: see text]). These results suggest that sufficient energy transfer from the lower limbs to the shoot arms is important to keep the motions of the shooting arms approximately constant when shooting from various distances.},

@article{Miller1993,
abstract = {Three-dimensional video techniques (50 Hz) were used to obtain images of basketball jump shots from one of three distances -short range (group 1, n = 5); medium range (group 2, n = 5); long range (group 3, n = 5) -from the basket, as performed by members of the men's quarter-finalist teams at the games of the XVI Universiade in Sheffield in 1991. Fifteen sequences were digitized, beginning 20 frames prior to take-off to 10 frames after release. To facilitate analysis, the sequences were rotated about the ball position in the final frame so that the shot direction was parallel to one of the pre-defined orthogonal axes. Mean (±1 s.d.) ball release speed was found to increase with distance from the basket (group 1 = 3.04 ± 0.65 m s-1, group 2 = 4.71 ± 0.74 m s-1, group 3 = 6.24 ± 0.80 m s-1) while mean release angles were similar for all groups (group 1 = 48.8 ± 10.1°, group 2 = 47.8 ± 5.8°, group 3 = 51.9 ± 5.5°). The increased impulse necessary for the ball to reach the basket at increased shooting distances was derived from both an increase in angular velocity of the elbow joint of the shooting arm and an increased velocity of the centre of mass in the direction of the basket at release. Centre of mass speed at take-off was found to be influenced to a greater extent by the angular velocity of the ankle joint than that of the knee or hip joints. Rotation of the hip and shoulder axes, facilitated by the forward placement of the foot on the side of the shooting arm (antero-posterior separation values: Group 1 = 0.17 ± 0.11 m, group 2 = 0.10 ± 0.14 m, group 3 = 0.09 ± 0.09 m) was utilized by all except one subject. All subjects also used an amount of medio-lateral foot separation which, along with antero-posterior separation, promoted stability. All the subjects released the ball while airborne. Both the maximum jump height and the height of the jump at release tended to decrease as shooting distance increased. For short-range shots, release occurred after the peak of the jump, but increasingly prior to the peak as shooting distance increased. {\textcopyright} 1993 E. {\&} F.N. Spon.},
